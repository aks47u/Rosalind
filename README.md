<p>
	Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Python Village</h3>
<p>
	If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You&#39;ll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Bioinformatics Stronghold</h3>
<p>
	Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Bioinformatics Armory</h3>
<p>
	Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.

<br />
<h3>Bioinformatics Textbook Track</h3>
<p>
	A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau &amp; Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org
</p>
<br />
<h3>Algorithmic Heights</h3>
<p>
	A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany &quot;Algorithms&quot;, the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
